# Connectome-Analysis
Scripts to analyse the hemibrain connectome

Contains two folders: **Stable** and **Development**

**Stable** 
Has scripts that should work for everyone to analyse the connectome. These have been tested on separate computers
- Use Example scripts to help you download the relevant data and packages. 
Before you start make sure you have the required python packages. These can be found in installed_packages.txt. These have the version names but I think up-to-date versions should also work fine.

**Development**
Has scripts under development by me (Charlie). Have a browse if you think there is anything useful in there, but be warned the code is not well annotated.

Please contact me if you find any bugs or things need explaining
